# === Sensitive Configuration ===
# Add secrets here as needed. Examples:

# API keys for external integrations (if any)
# EXTERNAL_API_KEY="your-key-here"

# Webhook secrets (if any)
# WEBHOOK_SECRET="your-secret-here"

# Note: Model provider API keys should be managed at the
# global Agent Zero level, not here, unless project-specific
# keys are needed.
