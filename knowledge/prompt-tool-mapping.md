# Prompt-Tool Mapping Knowledge

This file is optimized for agent reference and automated validation.

- For each prompt, see which tools/instruments and other prompts it references.
- For each tool, see which prompts reference it and its dependencies.
- Use the tables and graph below for quick lookup and validation.
